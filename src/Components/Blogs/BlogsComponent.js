    { id: 1, title: "HTML", description: "HTML, the backbone of web pages, provides the structure and content of a website, defining its various elements and their hierarchy. It allows developers to create web documents by marking up text files with tags that denote formatting, structure, and links to other documents or resources. HTML5, the latest version of HTML, introduces new elements and features that enhance web development, such as semantic tags, multimedia support, canvas for graphics, and more. With HTML, developers can build accessible, interactive, and visually appealing web experiences for users across different devices and platforms." },
    { id: 2, title: "JavaScript", description: "JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages, allowing for user interaction, form validation, animations, and more. As a versatile scripting language, JavaScript can be used to manipulate the DOM, handle events, make asynchronous HTTP requests, and create interactive user interfaces. With its widespread adoption and extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, JavaScript has become an essential tool for web developers, powering everything from simple websites to complex web applications." },
    { id: 3, title: "CSS", description: "CSS enhances the visual presentation of web pages, controlling the layout, styling, and appearance of HTML elements, making designs visually appealing. It allows developers to customize the look and feel of a website by specifying rules that define how elements should be displayed on screen. With CSS, developers can create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, improving the user experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones. CSS also enables the separation of content from design, making it easier to maintain and update web projects." },
    { id: 4, title: "Bootstrap", description: "Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that streamlines web development by providing pre-designed UI components, responsive layouts, and CSS utilities. It offers a grid system for organizing content, built-in typography styles, and a variety of components such as buttons, forms, navigation bars, and more. With Bootstrap, developers can quickly prototype and build responsive websites that look great on any device. It also includes JavaScript plugins for common UI interactions and supports customization through Sass variables and mixins." },
    { id: 5, title: "React", description: "React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage application state. With its component-based architecture and virtual DOM, React enables developers to build complex UIs from simple and composable components. It promotes a declarative programming style, where developers describe how the UI should look based on the current application state, and React takes care of updating the DOM efficiently. React's ecosystem includes tools like React Router for navigation, Redux for state management, and React Native for building mobile apps, making it a versatile choice for web development." }
